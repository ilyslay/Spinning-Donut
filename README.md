## **Step-by-Step Documentation for the 3D Spinning Donut in C++**

---

### **Step 1: Setting Up Constants and Variables**  
The code begins by defining key variables and constants needed for the 3D donut animation.  

```cpp
#define PI 3.14159265359
double A = 0, B = 0; // Rotation angles
const int screen_width = 80;
const int screen_height = 22;
const int buffer_size = screen_width * screen_height;
char buffer[buffer_size];  // Frame buffer
float zbuffer[buffer_size]; // Depth buffer

const double theta_spacing = 0.07;
const double phi_spacing = 0.02;
const double R1 = 1, R2 = 2, K2 = 5;
const double K1 = screen_width * K2 * 3 / (8 * (R1 + R2));
```

Here, `A` and `B` are rotation angles that will change continuously to give the donut its spinning effect. The **`screen_width`** and **`screen_height`** define the size of the console window where the animation will be displayed, while **`buffer_size`** stores the total number of characters that fit into the screen. The `buffer` is an array where ASCII characters for the current frame will be stored, and the `zbuffer` tracks the depth of points to handle which points are closer to the viewer.  

The `theta_spacing` and `phi_spacing` determine how many angles will be used to represent the donut. Smaller values create smoother shapes but may slow down rendering. Finally, **`R1`** and **`R2`** define the two radii of the torus (donut), where `R1` is the small ring’s radius and `R2` is the radius of the circle that the ring revolves around. `K1` is a scaling factor to ensure the donut fits well on the screen.  

---

### **Step 2: Clearing the Buffers**  
Before rendering each frame, both the **character buffer** and the **depth buffer** must be cleared to start fresh.  

```cpp
memset(buffer, ' ', buffer_size);
memset(zbuffer, 0, buffer_size * sizeof(float));
```

The `memset` function fills the entire `buffer` with spaces, which represents the empty background. It also resets the `zbuffer` to zero so that new depth values can be calculated correctly during the next frame. This ensures there are no remnants of previous frames when the new one is rendered.

---

### **Step 3: Looping Through Angles Theta and Phi**  
The next step is to calculate the 3D points on the surface of the donut using two angles, **`theta`** and **`phi`**. These loops cover all points on the torus surface.  

```cpp
for (double theta = 0; theta < 2 * PI; theta += theta_spacing) {
    for (double phi = 0; phi < 2 * PI; phi += phi_spacing) {
```

The outer loop iterates through different **`theta`** angles, representing positions along the small ring's circumference. The inner loop iterates through **`phi`** angles, representing rotations around the major circle of the torus. By varying both angles, the code can calculate the coordinates for every point on the surface of the donut.

---

### **Step 4: Calculating 3D Coordinates of the Donut**  
For each combination of `theta` and `phi`, the code calculates the **3D coordinates** of a point on the torus.  

```cpp
double circleX = R2 + R1 * cos(theta);
double circleY = R1 * sin(theta);
```

These equations determine the position of a point on the small ring. The `circleX` coordinate shifts the entire ring by `R2` units along the X-axis, ensuring it forms a larger circle. The `circleY` coordinate corresponds to the vertical position of the point on the small ring.  

---

### **Step 5: Applying Rotations to the 3D Coordinates**  
Once the 3D coordinates are calculated, the code applies **rotations** around two axes, using trigonometric functions.  

```cpp
double x = circleX * (cos(B) * cos(phi) + sin(A) * sin(B) * sin(phi)) 
           - circleY * cos(A) * sin(B);
double y = circleX * (sin(B) * cos(phi) - sin(A) * cos(B) * sin(phi)) 
           + circleY * cos(A) * cos(B);
double z = K2 + cos(A) * circleX * sin(phi) + circleY * sin(A);
```

These equations rotate each point based on the angles `A` and `B`. Rotation around the X-axis and Z-axis gives the illusion of spinning. As `A` and `B` change during the animation, the donut will rotate in a visually appealing way.  

---

### **Step 6: Performing Perspective Projection**  
To make the 3D points visible in a 2D console, the code performs **perspective projection**.  

```cpp
double ooz = 1 / z;
int xp = (int)(screen_width / 2 + K1 * ooz * x);
int yp = (int)(screen_height / 2 - K1 * ooz * y);
```

The `ooz` variable holds the **inverse of z** to give a perspective effect, making distant points appear smaller. The `xp` and `yp` values are the **2D coordinates** of the point on the screen, scaled and centered in the middle of the console.

---

### **Step 7: Calculating Surface Brightness**  
The brightness of each point is calculated based on its orientation to the light source.  

```cpp
double L = cos(phi) * cos(theta) * sin(B) 
         - cos(A) * cos(theta) * sin(phi) 
         - sin(A) * sin(theta) 
         + cos(B) * (cos(A) * sin(theta) - cos(theta) * sin(A) * sin(phi));
```

This equation approximates the amount of light hitting the surface at each point. Higher values of `L` correspond to brighter surfaces, while lower values represent darker ones, creating a shading effect.

---

### **Step 8: Using Depth Buffering and Selecting Characters for Shading**  
The code ensures that only the **closest points** are rendered and selects appropriate ASCII characters for shading.  

```cpp
if (L > 0 && xp >= 0 && xp < screen_width && yp >= 0 && yp < screen_height) {
    int idx = xp + screen_width * yp;
    if (ooz > zbuffer[idx]) {
        zbuffer[idx] = ooz;
        int luminance_index = L * 8;
        buffer[idx] = ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[luminance_index];
    }
}
```

Using the **depth buffer**, the code ensures that only the closest points are rendered at each position. The brightness `L` is scaled to an index that selects a character from the **".,-~:;=!*#$@"** string. Brighter points are rendered with characters like `#`, while dimmer ones use `.` or `,`.

---

### **Step 9: Printing the Frame**  
Each frame is printed by moving the cursor back to the top and displaying the characters in the buffer.  

```cpp
std::cout << "\x1b[H";
for (int j = 0; j < buffer_size; j++) {
    putchar(j % screen_width ? buffer[j] : '\n');
}
```

The **ANSI escape code** `\x1b[H` moves the cursor to the top-left corner to prevent scrolling. The characters stored in the buffer are printed row by row, with a newline at the end of each row.

---

### **Step 10: Incrementing Rotation Angles and Adding Frame Delay**  
After rendering each frame, the code updates the rotation angles and pauses briefly.  

```cpp
A += 0.04;
B += 0.02;
usleep(30000);  // 30ms delay for smooth animation
```

The angles `A` and `B` are incremented slightly to create the rotation effect. The **`usleep(30000)`** function introduces a 30ms delay, ensuring the animation runs smoothly at approximately **33 frames per second**.

---

### **Step 11: Main Loop and Cursor Management**  
The entire animation runs inside an **infinite loop**, with proper handling of the cursor.  

```cpp
std::cout << "\x1b[2J";  // Clear screen
std::cout << "\x1b[?25l";  // Hide cursor

while (true) {
    renderFrame();
}

std::cout << "\x1b[?25h";  // Show cursor on exit
```

The **ANSI escape codes** clear the screen and hide the cursor before the animation starts. The infinite loop keeps rendering frames until the program is stopped. When the program exits, the cursor is restored with `\x1b[?25h`.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This code creates a **3D spinning donut** using trigonometry, perspective projection, and ASCII art. The depth buffering ensures correct rendering, and the use of ANSI codes provides smooth animation. The
