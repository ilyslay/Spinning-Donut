# Documentation for Key Parts of the Code

 ## 1. *The Buffer Setup:*
    
   const int screen_width = 80;
   const int screen_height = 22;
   char buffer[buffer_size];
   float zbuffer[buffer_size];
   
 ###  Explanation:  
The `buffer` stores characters for each frame that will be displayed on the console. Each element in the `buffer` corresponds to a character on the screen. The `zbuffer` tracks the depth (z-axis) of each point in 3D space that will be displayed on the 2D screen. We need the z-buffer to handle the overlap of 3D points (ensuring closer points obscure farther ones).

   ### Why it's tricky:  
   This is a low-level graphics technique to simulate 3D rendering using only ASCII characters. Each pixel in `buffer` holds the final character, and `zbuffer` ensures proper depth is maintained for each frame.

## 2. *Rotation and Perspective Transformation:*
   
   double x = circleX * (cosB * cosPhi + sinA * sinB * sinPhi) - circleY * cosA * sinB;
   double y = circleX * (sinB * cosPhi - sinA * cosB * sinPhi) + circleY * cosA * cosB;
   double z = K2 + cosA * circleX * sinPhi + circleY * sinA;
   double ooz = 1 / z; // One over z
   
   ### Explanation:  
   These lines rotate the 3D donut in space. The formulae are derived from 3D rotation matrices. `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the 3D coordinates of each point on the surface of the donut after it's rotated. Then, `ooz` is computed as `1/z`, which is used to simulate perspective (closer objects appear larger).

  ### *Why it's tricky:*  
 The combination of trigonometric functions (`cos`, `sin`) with the 3D coordinates adds complexity. The rotation is applied in multiple dimensions, and these transformations are critical to making the donut appear to "spin" and give a sense of 3D depth.

## 3. *Brightness Calculation:*
   
   double L = cosPhi * cosTheta * sinB - cosA * cosTheta * sinPhi - sinA * sinTheta + cosB * (cosA * sinTheta - cosTheta * sinA * sinPhi);

   ### *Explanation:*
   This formula calculates the brightness of each point based on how much light it reflects. The brightness `L` is derived from the surface normal and light direction. The normal vector is computed from the donut's surface angles, and its dot product with the light vector gives a measure of how much light is reflected.

   ### **Why it's tricky:**  
   The brightness is derived using trigonometry based on the angles of the torus and the position of a light source, which involves combining multiple trigonometric terms. It's a simplified version of how lighting works in 3D graphics but difficult to follow due to the complexity of combining different rotations and surface orientations.

## 4. *Depth (Z-buffer) and Character Assignment:*
   if (L > 0 && xp >= 0 && xp < screen_width && yp >= 0 && yp < screen_height) {
       int idx = xp + screen_width * yp;
       if (ooz > zbuffer[idx]) {
           zbuffer[idx] = ooz;
           int luminance_index = L * 8;
           buffer[idx] = ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[luminance_index];
       }
   }
   
   ### *Explanation:* 
   Here, we ensure that only points within the screen boundaries are drawn. The `zbuffer[idx]` stores the depth for each point (if it's closer to the viewer than a previously drawn point). If so, the character representing the brightness (from a pre-defined list of ASCII characters) is assigned to the `buffer`.

   ### *Why it's tricky:* 
   This part integrates multiple things: screen boundary checks, depth-buffer handling (ensuring correct z-depth), and brightness-based character selection. If the `zbuffer` isn't used correctly, the donut won't render properly, and the depth order will break.

This code efficiently renders a spinning donut in ASCII art by combining complex 3D geometry, rotation matrices, depth management, and brightness calculations for a sense of lighting.
